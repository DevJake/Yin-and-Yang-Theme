# Yin and Yang Obsidian Theme
Welcome to the Yin and Yang Obsidian theme! This theme was created to with both dark mode and light mode in mind. Hopefully you too will enjoy the stark contrast in colors.

## Plugins to Use
- Style Settings: I've only added a few customizable features using this plugin but I will be sure to add more in the next few days.
- Hider: This will allow you to hide various elements of the Obsidian UI.
