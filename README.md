# How To Install
Find this theme in the Obsidian's community themes browser under Settings > Appearance > Themes.

Alternatively, download Solarized.css to .obsidian/themes in your Vault folder and activate it under Settings > Appearance. (For older versions of Obsidian that do not support themes yet, rename Solarized.css to obsidian.css and place it in the root of your Vault.)
